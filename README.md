# Etch-a-sketch

This is my solution to Etch A Sketch project from The Odin Project.

**How Does It Work**
- you can draw a sketch using your mouse to click any squre you want.

- each click adds 10% opacity to the square.so exactly ten clicks gives the square full opavity.

- you can select the number of squares per side by click the button above the sketch board.
